1. fill the yaml file with
- ESXi Management IP: IDRAC IP
- IDRAC Username
- IDRAC Password

2. Make sure vMotion can work properly in the cluster you want to test

3. Run any HCIBench testing you want

4. Run the failure_test.rb script, the script will
- empty a random ESXi by moving VMs off to other ESXis
- hard-reboot the ESXi by running iDRAC cmd
- wait for the ESXi to come back, and resync is finished
- repeat the steps above

5. in the end, you can compare the results of HCIBench with non-failure scenario
